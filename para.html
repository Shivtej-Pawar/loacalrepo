**Subject:** Request for Cancellation of Honours Degree Enrollment  



I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to formally request the cancellation of my enrollment in the Honours degree program in **Big Data Analysis**. After careful consideration, I have decided not to pursue this opportunity due to personal priorities and commitments.  

I sincerely appreciate being selected for this program and the trust placed in my abilities. However, I believe this decision aligns better with my current goals.  

Please let me know if any formalities are required from my side to complete the cancellation process.  

Thank you for your understanding and support.  

Best regards,  
Shivtej Anandrao Pawar  
**Enrollment Number:** 23UAD052
